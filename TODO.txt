Minor bugs
----------

Sometimes the log view is repainted incorrectly when you are in grouped view
with a scrollbar, and add an entry for an existing activity.

Midnight handling sometimes acts funny and you need to refresh the view.


Unimplemented features
----------------------

Options dialog.

Re-reading of timelog.txt should be automatic (watch mtime of the file).

History browsing.

Better integration with GNOME (gconf for options, use user's preferred editor
and mailer).

More options: "virtual midnight" (currently hardcoded at 2 am).
